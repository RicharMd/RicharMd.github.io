# Yiteng Mao (毛弋滕)

**Junior CS Student @ UW-Madison (Incoming Spring 2026)**  
*Previously @ CUHK-Shenzhen (Top 10%)*

👋 Hi, I'm Yiteng. I am a **Methodology-Driven AI Researcher** with a strong foundation in **Systems Engineering**. 
My research interest lies in the intersection of **Model Architecture Innovation**, **Neuro-Symbolic AI**, and **Training Paradigm Shifts**. 

Unlike a pure theorist, I build systems. Unlike a pure engineer, I seek mathematical intuition.
