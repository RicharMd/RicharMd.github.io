## 🔬 Research Vision

I am a researcher driven by **Methodology** rather than just benchmarks. My goal is to shift **Post-training paradigms (RLHF)** to enable true emergence and internalize "Hallucination Awareness" in LLMs.

I am currently pivoting from **Formal Verification (Lean4)** to **Empirical Evaluation**, believing that solving the "Evaluation Gap" in OOD human errors is the key to reliable Reward Modeling.

## 🚀 Ongoing Research

### [1. Pointing Benchmark: Real-world Reasoning Evaluation](./)
> *Independent Research | Advisor: Prof. Hongyuan Zha*
*   **The Problem**: SOTA LLM Judges are "convergent" (good at grading LLMs) but fail at grading "divergent" human errors (MSE 2.96 vs 1.54).
*   **The Fix**: Constructed a benchmark with **300+ authentic high-school assessments** and expert annotations.
*   **The Insight**: Proposing that human errors are OOD for current Reward Models.

### [2. Lean4Eval: Formal Reasoning for LLMs](./)
> *Research Assistant | Advisor: Prof. Hongyuan Zha*
*   Explored **Neuro-Symbolic** integration using Lean4 to provide unambiguous "System 2" verification for LLM outputs.
